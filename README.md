The project focuses on analyzing the performance of SimpleRNN, LSTM, and hybrid models (LSTM + GRU) in predicting temperature forecasting. The objective is to determine why the SimpleRNN model outperforms more complex models like LSTM and hybrid architectures for this specific task. Temperature forecasting, often relying on short-term patterns such as the past 7 to 30 days, involves data that may not require the sophisticated memory management of LSTM or GRU. The study highlights several key factors driving SimpleRNN's superior performance, including its ability to handle short-term dependencies, reduced risk of overfitting, and faster convergence during training. The complex architecture of LSTM and GRU models, with their numerous parameters, can lead to overfitting, especially when working with small or noisy datasets. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in training stability and require more tuning to avoid local minima. The project concludes that, given the simpler nature of the task and the characteristics of the data, SimpleRNN is a more efficient choice for temperature prediction, demonstrating both practical and computational advantages. This comparison emphasizes the importance of model selection based on task complexity and dataset characteristics, offering valuable insights for time series forecasting applications
